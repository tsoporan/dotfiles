# dotfiles

Collection of dotfiles for my day-to-day programs.

### My setup

- [ArchLinux](https://www.archlinux.org/)
- [AwesomeWM](https://awesomewm.org/)
- [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)
- [rofi/rofi-pass](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi)
- [kitty term](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty)
- [vim](https://www.vim.org/)
- [zsh](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/zsh)
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
- [Fira Code font](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)

### Dotfile usage

Using `stow` simply `stow <dirname>` from within the cloned dir.

```bash
# For example to add the vim config
stow vim
# Notice now that ~/.vimrc is linked
```

Enjoy!

### Theme

The theme is customized for my needs but heavily based on: [awesome-pro](https://github.com/4ban/awesome-pro) - check it out!
